Email revolutionized the way we communicate on a global scale. Never before were we able to send a message as fast and as precisley as email does.
To send an email one must have a specific address in mind so that the simple mail transfer protocol knows where to send the message. Then the mail trasfer agents takes the message to the desired location
The first email was sent in 1971 by a man named Ray Tomlinson on something called ARPANEt which hosted different users who could use email to send messages to one another.
