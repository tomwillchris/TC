I chose to sign the pettition on we the people for EPA to stop trying to regulate automobiles.
Cars are an american pass time and a passion that a lot of Americans take very seriously including myself. 
The EPA would like to prevent anyone from modifying their vehicle to go faster in any way shape or form. 
If the EPA succeed in what they are doing it could be the start of major legislation that restricts our right to be american.
