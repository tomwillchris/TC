So I spend about 20 minutes searching for a picture of a router hanging off a table, building etc to take your assignment most litterally but I failed. Something I think that is incredibly unsecure is free wifi or any hotspot that is open and you connect to. Unless its a comcast or a reputable establishment, no way I am connecting to you. However most people these days have data caps and enjoy using wifi whenever they can. People will connect to just about any network as long as it makes their instagram feed refresh. However this is incredibly unsafe. Lets say a malicious individual wants to get some data from people. All he has to do is go to a public place and make a hotspot on his device. He names it "AT&T WIFI" now all he has to do is wait. As more and more people connect he has all the information he needs to start doing some real damage. CC numbers log in info  anything you do on that network the person hosting it can monitor. I think there needs to be a drastic change in both education and policy regarding this issue.
